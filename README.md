# Sales Order Creator
## *with the UX of Online Shopping*

The full concept for this project is to create a system for end-users to create their a sales order in an extremely user-friendly way.

These end-users will be speaking to a customer on the phone while creating the sales order and so the feel should be that of online shopping.

As the end-user is collecting the necessary information quantity, price, etc. the system will calculate and display the commission for the order based on current selections.

Afterwards the information is compiled into a document and sent to for review, approval, and entry into accounting.

(Future Phase: Review and approval process will be part of the app, and entry into accounting will be automated)
